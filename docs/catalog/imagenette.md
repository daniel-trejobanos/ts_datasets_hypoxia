# `imagenette`

*   **Description**:

Imagenette is a subset of 10 easily classified classes from the Imagenet
dataset. It was originally prepared by Jeremy Howard of FastAI. The objective
behind putting together a small version of the Imagenet dataset was mainly
because running new ideas/algorithms/experiments on the whole Imagenet take a
lot of time.

This version of the dataset allows researchers/practitioners to quickly try out
ideas and share with others. The dataset comes in three variants:

*   Full size
*   320 px
*   160 px This dataset consists of the Imagenette dataset {size} variant.
